      <h2>Gleneden Cavachon &amp; Cavanese Puppies: Love at First Sight!</h2>
    
      <p>Each puppy is a treasure. Their home at Gleneden is state-of-the-art in terms of features for care, safety and comfort. Professionally cleaned and sterilized daily, high-tech insulated- ventilated, zone heated and air-conditioned, no corners cut  - period.</p>

      <p>Puppies are placed one at a time, taking into consideration the suitability of the prospective home. This is done in a positive spirit, not one of trying to be “exclusive" but rather in knowing from lengthy experience that some situations are just not conducive for a good dog - human family relationship. And that is something we care about, a lot.</p>

      <p>We follow a vigorous state of the art vaccination and deworming program. Judging by the overwhelming majority of messages we receive from owners, our pups can be expected to retain their good health and vitality as they mature into adult dogs.</p>

      <p>Puppies are sold with care and training instructions, vaccination and health records, and a written health warranty for genetic and hereditary disorders. Puppies microchipped upon request.</p>

          <p>From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before!</p>

          <p>Here's how it is: Earth got used up, so we terraformed a whole new galaxy of Earths, some rich and flush with the new technologies, some not so much. Central Planets, them was formed the Alliance, waged war to bring everyone under their rule; a few idiots tried to fight it, among them myself. I'm Malcolm Reynolds, captain of Serenity. Got a good crew: fighters, pilot, mechanic. We even picked up a preacher, and a bona fide companion. There's a doctor, too, took his genius sister out of some Alliance camp, so they're keeping a low profile. You got a job, we can do it, don't much care what it is.</p>

We've now been doing allergy injections for several months, and his itching and redness have nearly gone away.

            <span class="more">and urinating excessively, we brought her to see the specialists at Wisdom. After running a blood test, Dr. Winthrop confirmed what we all feared - Samantha was showing signs of diabetes. The doctor put us on a daily routine to provide Samantha insulin injections, and showed us how to administer the shots. We weren't sure we could do it, but the gang at Wisdom was very supportive and encouraging. Now, two years later, Samantha is still free from any complications of diabetes, and her blood sugar regularly tests normal. Thank you, Wisdom Pet Medicine!</span>

            <span class="intro">The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to determine why our three-year old</span>
            <span class="more">Golden Retriever, Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and provided fluids until her kidneys were again functioning normally, but it was still a mystery as to what caused her health to decline so quickly. The vet noted our address on Roxie's chart, and asked if we lived on one of the orchards in the vicinity, and if Roxie had a habit of eating grapes off the vine. Our answer was "of course – she's a Retriever." That day we learned just how toxic grapes and raisins are to pets, and Roxie is no longer allowed to roam unattended in the orchard.</span>

When our 13-year old Comet goldfish, McAllister, turned from silvery white to an angry red, we called around, urgently trying to find a veterinarian who could help. Wisdom not only got us in the same day, but also was able to diagnose McAllister as having a severe case of septicemia. In order to kill the harmful bacteria in his blood, we had to use a dog antibiotic in his tank every day for a week, and in the end, McAllister was good as new. I still smile upon remembering Dr. Chase pulling out an old vet school textbook to calculate the correct antibiotic dose for a fish!</span>

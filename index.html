      <h2><i class="fa fa-heart"></i>&nbsp; Love at First Sight &nbsp;</h2>
      
      <p>At Gleneden we are devoted to raising beautiful, healthy, affectionate puppies and making them available to responsible dog lovers. Gleneden was the very first breeder of Cavachons. In fact, we coined the name. From that beginning about fifteen years ago, these wonderful, versatile dogs have been in great demand. The pups are raised in a loving family environment and are fully socialized. The large farm acreage provides plenty of room for our studs, brood bitches, and puppies to romp. The environment often lead folks visiting to jokingly comment that they wouldn’t mind trading places with the livestock.</p>

      <p>Weaned from mother at 6 1/2 to 7 weeks of age, the puppies are generally available for adoption about two weeks later. The temperament of the males and females is basically the same. Neither sex is harder to house train and both are equally playful, intelligent, affectionate, non-aggressive and loveable.</p>

                  <h2>Cavachon</h2>
                  
                  <p>Cavachons possess the characteristics that so many folks are looking for in a companion or family dog. That is, a most friendly nature, intelligence, gentleness, playfulness, small size, low exercise requirements and a low or no shed coat. And, as the photos here reveal, they are most handsome. Oh, and a unscientific poll recently conducted here at Gleneden indicated that they are the favorite puppy for young children to play with and cuddle.</p>

                  <p>Being true hybrids, the offspring of royally bred Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and superb Bichon Frises, Gleneden Cavachons are known for their healthy vigor, not the congenital and structural defects so rampant in many purebreed animals. At Gleneden puppies are introduced to children, other animals, a variety of people, different scents and sounds. In fact, you might say the puppies are "grandchildrenized".</p>

                  <p>Adult weights of our Cavachons are typically less than 20 pounds although a host of factors including diet and exercise can influence growth and development. The Cavachon come in peach &amp; white, peach, sable &amp; white, tri-colored and black and tan. And, of interest to many prospective dog owners, Cavachons seem in most instances to be fully compatible with allergy sufferers.</p>

                  <h2>Cavanese</h2>
                  
                  <p> Having successfully bred Cavachons for a number of years we came to realize that some folks preferred a more straight coat on their small size dogs.  We therefore also offer the Cavanese, a cross of the Havanese and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.</p>
                  
                  <p>The Havanese, once called the Havana Silk Dog,  have been bred for centuries as companion dogs. Crossed with the regal, gentle Cavalier, the Cavanese  captures the best qualities of both breeds - a hearty, outgoing and  happy disposition, small sturdy size, hypoallergenic, nonshed coat, and hybrid vigor. They have fast become one of the more popular small dog choices. Feedback to Gleneden suggests that they are very responsive not only to basic training but to games and trick learning. "Dunkin", a Gleneden Cavanese, for instance, has achieved celebrity star status in the Charleston, South Carolina area.</p>

                  <p>You will find the Cavanese to be most similar to our famous Cavachons. Owners rave about their high trainability, intelligence, and loving nature. They will make an excellent companion for you and the entire family. They come in a variety of colors, including black and tan, partis, and sables. A most handsome dog!</p>

          <h3>Puppy Placement</h3>
          <p>We place puppies one at a time, taking into consideration the suitability of the prospective home. This is done in a positive spirit, not one of trying to be “exclusive" but rather in knowing from lengthy experience that some situations are just not conducive for a good dog - human family relationship. And that is something we care about, a lot.</p>

He is a complete love with the sweetest personality. Our son David has had no issues with allergies so a cavachon was the right choice in many ways. We are thinking Ace needs a brother this spring!!

She is such a sweet girl. We continue to adore her and truly can't imagine life without her! She loves to cuddle and is always resting her head on my shoulder or lap. I've been taking her to the beach a lot this summer - she LOVES playing in the sand! She likes learning new tricks. I think she would make a great therapy dog! Here are some recent pictures :)</p>

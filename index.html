            <p>From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before!</p>

            <p>Here's how it is: Earth got used up, so we terraformed a whole new galaxy of Earths, some rich and flush with the new technologies, some not so much. Central Planets, them was formed the Alliance, waged war to bring everyone under their rule; a few idiots tried to fight it, among them myself. I'm Malcolm Reynolds, captain of Serenity. Got a good crew: fighters, pilot, mechanic. We even picked up a preacher, and a bona fide companion. There's a doctor, too, took his genius sister out of some Alliance camp, so they're keeping a low profile. You got a job, we can do it, don't much care what it is.</p>

          <h3>Puppy Placement</h3>
          <p>We place puppies one at a time, taking into consideration the suitability of the prospective home. This is done in a positive spirit, not one of trying to be “exclusive" but rather in knowing from lengthy experience that some situations are just not conducive for a good dog - human family relationship. And that is something we care about, a lot.</p>

          <h3>A Healthy History</h3>
          <p>Puppies are sold with care and training instructions, vaccination and health records, and a written health warranty for genetic and hereditary disorders. Judging by the overwhelming majority of messages we receive from owners, our pups can be expected to retain their good health and vitality as they mature into adult dogs.</p>

              <h3>Judith and Marc Mann <br>Connecticut</h3>
              <p>Hello Judy. In the Spring of 2009, we found our Cavachon puppy at Gleneden.  It was one of the best days of our lives.  He was 3 months old when we got him and he's a healthy 6 years old now.  Our pediatrician says that he's never seen a healthier dog.  Marc is a psychologist and Tiki has become a therapy dog, going to work with Marc 4 days a week to the delight of his patients.  We love him so much that nothing would thrill us more than to come back and buy another.  Tiki is the most gentle, sweet, and kind dog that we have ever had, and would be a wonderful big "brother" to a new puppy...</p>

              <p>Hi Judy! Just checking in and sending some photos of Ace. He will be 3 years old in February and we will be celebrating his "Bark Mizvah" with 10 of his dog friends. He is a complete love with the sweetest personality. Our son David has had no issues with allergies so a cavachon was the right choice in many ways. We are thinking Ace needs a brother this spring!! We'll keep you posted!</p>

             <p>Hello Judy, We adopted our Daisy in December 2014. She is so precious, cute, nice, and special. She is the best dog in the world. We enjoy how she is so affectionate! Your dogs are so meaningful to families. Thank you for your wonderful dogs. We also got her spayed in early April. </p>
